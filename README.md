# Online-Test-Application
The Online Test Application system creates an application that enables users to provide online tests, review them, and display the results.
System Details
This system contains three main modules: Quiz, Review, and Result. The quiz section of the online test application accepts the questions in JSON format. The JSON file can be easily shared from the server in the pre-defined format. The application renders the test at the client-side.
The “Review and display result” section allows users to declare the results immediately. You can simply call another JSON with the answers in it and evaluate and display the results immediately.

Conclusion:
The Online Test Application is user-friendly, very simple and convenient to use. The system is complete in that it is operational and under test by entering the data and getting the reports in the correct order. But there is always room for improvement. During the development of this, coding standards are followed for ease of maintenance and scalability. The project has been successfully designed and is tested for accuracy and quality. During this project, I achieved all the goals and this project meets the needs of the assigned requirements.
